          <h2>Submission Policies</h2>
          
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li>
              <strong>Paper format:</strong> The paper format is A4, two columns. Refer to the author kit for detailed formatting instructions. Papers must be submitted as PDF files (20MB file size limit).
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <strong>Paper length:</strong> The allowed paper length is 6 to 8 pages (additional pages only containing references are allowed).
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <strong>Language:</strong> All papers must be written in English.
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <strong>Double-blind review:</strong> CVWW 2026 reviewing is double-blind, i.e., authors do not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers do not know the names of the authors. Please read the example paper (author kit) for detailed instructions on how to preserve anonymity. Also remember to avoid information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g. co-workers and grant IDs) and in the supplemental material (e.g. titles in the movies, or attached papers).
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <strong>Supplementary material:</strong> Authors may optionally upload supplementary material. Typically, this material might include result videos that cannot be included in the main paper, anonymized related submissions to other conferences and journals, and appendices or technical reports containing extended proofs and mathematical derivations that are not essential for the understanding of the paper. Note that the contents of the supplementary material should be referred to appropriately in the paper and that reviewers are not obliged to look at the submitted material. All supplementary material must be zipped into a single file. There is a 100MB limit on the size of this file.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Papers will be rejected without review if they:</h3>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li>do not contain 6 to 8 pages (excl. references),</li>
            <li>violate the double-blind policy, or</li>

          <h2>Contributed papers vs Feedback track</h2>

          <p>The papers submitted to the <strong>contributed papers</strong> track are expected to present novel work. These papers will enter the reviewing process and accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings.</p>
          <p>Alternatively, if you would like to possibly receive some feedback (at the discretion of experienced researchers) but not submit the paper, choose the <strong>feedback track</strong>. Note that if you do so, your paper will not go into the review process and will not be published. Based on the feedback, contributions to this track can be accepted as (student) invited talks.</p>
          <p>The track can be selected when creating a new paper ID in the CMT submission system.</p>

          <h2>Author Kit</h2>
          
          <p>The CVWW 2026 author kit will be available soon. It will provide the official LaTeX template to prepare your submissions. Note that the paper ID will be assigned to you when you first register your submission via the CVWW CMT website. Please replace the asterisks in the template with your paper's own ID before submitting your paper.</p>

          </div>

          <p>Please refer to the example paper within the author kit for detailed author guidelines and formatting instructions. If you intend to use something other than LaTeX to prepare your paper (e.g. MS Word), you have to ensure that your paper looks as expected by yourself.</p>

          <h3>Author Kit Remarks</h3>
          <p>The author kit is based on the recent CVPR/ICCV/3DV paper template, following the modernized format adopted by CVWW 2025 (<a class="link" href="https://github.com/snototter/CVWW-Author-Kit/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github</a>). CVWW authors should not use templates from previous editions to prepare their submissions.</p>
